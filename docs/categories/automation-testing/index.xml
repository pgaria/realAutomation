      <description>In TestNG, we can divide our test cases into multiple classes. Every class can have multiple @test methods.Sometimes Class represents a particular feature and all the test cases are inside the class. So in this article, we are going to learn how we can run multiple tests having multiple classes in TestNG.
Lets make few example test Classes: We will first make few Test Class with multiple @Test. To run all the Classes we should create a testng.</description>

      <description>TestNG provides an attribute for enabling and disable our @Test. There are many times when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to run particular @Test and it&amp;rsquo;s not a better way to remove the whole Test method from the class and then add again if you want to run the @Test again.
 By default all the TestNG @Test methods are Enabled
 How to Enable and Disable @Test: To enable and disable @test, There is an attribute enabled which accepts Boolean type value as True or False.</description>

      <description>Skipping test is also an important concept in TestNG. You can skip the test from running as you don&amp;rsquo;t want to Run the @test and mark the @test as Skip in reports.
To Skip the test we need to use org.testng.SkipException an Exception Class from TestNG. We have to throw an exception to the first line and code will come out from the test. You can have a look at Java document to read more about exception throwing.</description>

      <description>All exceptions are not bad in our product, means we have to test and verify the exceptions in our product. The ExpectedException is a way of verifying that your code throws a specific exception.
 Verifying that code completes normally is important, but making sure the logic behaves as expected in failure and unexpected situations are also important.
 In TestNG, we have an attribute as expectedExceptions which needs to be added to our test where we have to verify the Exception as expected.</description>

      <description>In testing Test is considered successful if it completed without throwing an exception or test successfully validated expected results. Sometimes @test threw an exception that was expected and we mark test as success. TestNG can not just decide what should be the results of the Test by himself, So we need to provide the expected data and expected conditions.
TestNG use the concept of Assert from Java and can be used for adding validation and conditions in your test cases.</description>

      <description>TestNG.xml file is an XML file which contains all the Test configuration and this XML file can be used to run and organize our test. TestNG eclipse plugin can be used to automatically generate testng.xml file so no need to write from scratch. In this article, we are going to learn about what is testng.xml and how to use testng.xml file to run our test.
Create Class with multiple @test methods: First, we need to create a simple class which contains multiple @test methods.</description>

      <description>Before talking about annotations we should talk a little bit about why TestNG is required and what is the need for using any test management frameworks in our test.
All the tests are designed to allow you to quickly verify your application using a very large and diverse set of different data inputs. So test management tools are responsible for managing our test and provide many functionalities or you can say methods we can directly use in Test and no need to write the logic again like comparing two objects, pre-setup for Test, passing a different set of data and many more.</description>

      <description>Browser automation from command-line is possible after the release of HTTP servers like ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver which are implementing the W3C WebDriver standard and follow all the standards of a normal server-client architecture in HTTP.
In my other posts, I have described what is JSONWire Protocol and how it became a standard for the browser automation. I also described how we can perform browser automation using postman tool. Now in this article, I will show you how we can use simple curl HTTP commands to drive Chrome Browser.</description>

      <description>If you are using WebDriver or learning how to use Selenium for test automation, you must be using some programming language like Java or PHP, etc. for automation and performing actions on browsers like Chrome. But in this article we are not going to use WebDriver Client Like Java or PHP, etc. and we will perform actions like open URL, Click Button or Enter Text using ChromeDriver and PostMan tool.</description>

      <description>ChromeDriver is a separate executable which can be used by all the Client libraries to Automate and control Chrome Browser. ChromeDriver implements all the standard for the WebDriver which is JSON WireProtocol and communicates based on those protocols. It receives HTTP request and provides HTTP response to the Client. ChromeDriver is not client dependent and separate from the clients like Java, Python, PHP etc. You can use the same ChromeDriver with any of the programming languages as the client.</description>

      <description>What is RemoteWebDriver? RemoteWebDriver in Selenium Webdriver implements each of the JSONWireProtocol commands and maps them into an action that can be performed on a remote machine.
RemoteWebDriver is a Class in the package org.openqa.selenium.remote inside the Client Project of WebDiver. RemoteWebDriver.class implements multiple interface like WebDriver(Yes WebDriver is an Interface not a Class as I have seen many people confused about this information), FindsById, FindsByClassName, FindsByLinkText etc.

      <description>Selenium WebDriver provides cool interface API&amp;rsquo;s to perform many actions on the browser and simulate the user behaviors like the click or enter Text in the TextBoxes. There are many good articles about the WebDriver on the internet but the purpose of this article is to understand what happens in the background when we use actions like click, finding an element or getting title etc. I will be using Java as a programming language in this article.</description>

      <description>Selenium WebDriver provides a programming interface for driving the browser for automation testing. You can find the introduction of WebDriver in my other article. This article is more about the architecture and understanding how selenium WebDriver uses JSON Wire Protocol.
JSON Wire Protocol is an abstract specification of how automation behavior like clicking or typing or whatever you actually want to do with your automation script is mapped to selenium or appium or HTTP requests and response.</description>
