      <description>If you are using WebDriver or learning how to use Selenium for automation, you must be using some programming language like Java or PHP etc. for automation and performing actions on browsers like Chrome. But in this article, I am going to show you how we can run the same test and perform an action on Chrome using ChromeDriver and PostMan.
I am going to use JSON Wire Protocol for driving chrome driver.</description>

      <description>ChromeDriver is a separate executable which can be used by all the Client libraries to Automate and control Chrome Browser. ChromeDriver implements all the standard for the WebDriver which is JSON WireProtocol and communicates based on those protocols. It receives HTTP request and provides HTTP response to the Client. ChromeDriver is not client dependent and separate from the clients like Java, Python, PHP etc. You can use the same ChromeDriver with any of the programming languages as the client.</description>

      <description>What is RemoteWebDriver? RemoteWebDriver in Selenium Webdriver implements each of the JSONWireProtocol commands and maps them into an action that can be performed on a remote machine.
RemoteWebDriver is a Class in the package org.openqa.selenium.remote inside the Client Project of WebDiver. RemoteWebDriver.class implements multiple interface like WebDriver(Yes WebDriver is an Interface not a Class as I have seen many people confused about this information), FindsById, FindsByClassName, FindsByLinkText etc.
package org.</description>

      <description>Selenium WebDriver provides cool interface API&amp;rsquo;s to perform many actions on the browser and simulate the user behaviors like the click or enter Text in the TextBoxes. There are many good articles about the WebDriver on the internet but the purpose of this article is to understand what happens in the background when we use actions like click, finding an element or getting title etc. I will be using Java as a programming language in this article.</description>

      <description>What is TestRail? Gurock TestRail is a modern and very nice tool for the Test Case Management by Quality Assurance and Development Team. TestManagement tools are very helpful for managing the test cases and TestRail is pack with very useful features like web-based application, Rest API integration etc.
Why to use TestManagement Tool with Automation? While making Regression or any kind of Test Automation suit there is a need of maintaining Use cases and maintain the repository which anyone can access and see what use cases are been automated and what is left.</description>
