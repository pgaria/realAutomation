      <description>All exceptions are not bad in our product, means we have to test and verify the exceptions in our product. The ExpectedException is a way of verifying that your code throws a specific exception.
 Verifying that code completes normally is important, but making sure the logic behaves as expected in failure and unexpected situations are also important.
 In TestNG, we have an attribute as expectedExceptions which needs to be added to our test where we have to verify the Exception as expected.</description>
