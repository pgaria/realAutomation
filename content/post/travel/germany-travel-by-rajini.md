Germany has not been so-called “Touristic attraction” if you compare with other parts of Europe like Switzerland, Italy, Rome, Paris etc. But seems to influence the aspirants across the globe for several reasons, be it Worlds top Brand Vehicles, Free education in schools and Universities (except private schools and colleges), social support from government and most important: the German language influence.

I would like to share the general small piece of information for the people who have the zeal to move or maybe want to settle here.

### Cost of living:
The first thing comes to mind when moving new Country is, Budget/ direct or indirect expenses. Though it’s not a cake walk, however, it’s not even out of sight too. Germany is very reasonable if you compare with the other developed countries like Switzerland, France, London, Singapore etc. you will get the necessities at very reasonable price in supermarkets. Even you will find different categories of supermarkets, selling cheapest to most expensive kinds of stuff. Next things come to mind is: Rent of house and living cost: I found it little overpriced. No doubt, you will get the house in well-maintained condition but still, when you calculate the gas, energy and other side costs, it sounds little expensive. Furnished and unfurnished apartments will have a difference in rent from high to low.In big cities, you might end up paying high rent for the small area. “ so it’s just to check your offer letter thoroughly before you plan to move. For students, there are also shared Apartments in fewer costs. Still one should plan the budget wisely. This might disturb you that finding Apartments in Germany from last few years has been a challenge.

### Health:
I will rate the health insurance facilities on top. The government here believes in giving priority to health first.No matter if you are student or job holder or mere Immigrant, the moment you enter this country, you are entitled to get your insurance done. Job holders pay the part of the monthly salary, the university takes to care for students and Refugees get it for free from government. It is a must that you should get your basic health check done every year. Special medical cases are also covered by insurance. Except for some medications rest covered in insurance. You can further choose what kind of insurance card or company you want to go for challenging is finding a specialist Doctor unless you have an emergency:)

### Food:
In comparison with the US and other Asian countries, food quality has been a standard in Europe. The quality of food is best. Though will be difficult for Asians to get the options in food, you can always buy kinds of stuff from Supermarkets or order online and try cooking at home. Not really bothersome for Americans or Europeans. :)

### Education:
As I mentioned, education from the government is free of cost. Almost 90% of German kids go in schools run by the government. I will definitely not question the quality of studies in government and private schools because there is almost no difference. In  Government schools, your kid will be taught in German, unlike International private schools where English is preferred. No wonder that the German language is powerful!! In university also the education is free and apart from that, there are also some special schools affiliated to the university which gives you scholarships if you get selected for projects or within criteria. Also, it’s very helpful that there are separate department - “welcome Centre for international students” in the university for students who are coming across the world to study here

### Jobs:
This time Germany is in need of people, they are encouraging more people even outside the world to come and work for them. Because of declining population and steep downfall in childbirth rates. Germany is lacking skilled resources. This is the best time when you can plan for studies in Germany or apply for jobs. But don’t forget to learn German before you plan :)
